## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability simply open a Github issue. You can expect to 
receive a response with a day or two, though this is not a hard and fast rule.
If the vulnerability is accepted it will be prioritized relative to its severity.
As a general principal security issues are prioritized ahead of all other work. 
If the issue is declined the rational will be note in Github issue.
